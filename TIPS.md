Instructions for play

- While some parts of the mod are scripted, many parts (such as exploring and building/placing of invaders after setup) are not
- When playing single player you can ignore the ready token and the "ready" text at the upper right (it's used for coordination among players)
- Do not hit the rewind/fastforward (they do not work well with scripted mods)
- To look at the reverse side of your spirit panel press Alt+Shift (default keybinding in TTS) and mouse over the spirit panel 
- To zoom in on a card hold the Alt key (default keybinding in TTS) and mouse over the card/object

Intermediate Tips:
- Press numpad keys (as shown in the bottom right) to spawn new pieces
  - Make sure numlock is enabled
  - Note that these scripting keys can be rebound in the TTS settings
- Lock pieces (right-click and select lock)
- Mark damage on pieces by changing the state
  - i.e. to mark one damage on a town, right click the town and change the state to 2
  - You can also press a number key to change the state (so press 2 to change the state to 2)
  - Note that invaders that have extra health or deal extra damage are rendered in a different color (i.e. red for england buildings, and blue for russian explorers)
- Defend values can also be set as a state
- To prevent a piece from going away during time passes you should lock it (right-click and select lock)
- You can use energy tokens instead of the counter by deleting the energy counter (right-click on the energy counter and press delete)
  
Advanced Tips:
- UI elements can be enabled and disabled with the little triangle near the top-right of your screen
- You can play double-handed (i.e. play 2 or more spirits) by changing your TTS player color in the top-right of the screen and choosing another spirit
  - Note that your UI elements are tracked per spirit
- You can bind keys to many other actions with options->keys (TODO check name)
- When playing as Shroud of Silent Mist it's important to not heal invaders and dahan in its land when time passes
  - You can do this by locking the bottom invader in a stack or by stacking the damaged invader on top of a scenario token
- If you play thresholded "Cast Down Into the Briny Deeps" use the gizmo tool (one of the tools on the left side of the screen) to move the island board
- You can choose what island boards to play with at setup by placing the island boards before starting your game
- To change what spirit you're playing after you've already started the game either reload the mod to restart everything, or unlock the spirit panel (right-click and press lock) and delete the spirit panel and any extra tokens/cards it has (right-click and select delete), then drag over a new spirit panel.
